# SentiTSMixer - Running the Colab Notebook

This README will guide you through the process of setting up and running the notebook.
You need Python 3.9.20 to be installed beforehand

## Prerequisites

Before running the Colab notebook, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required packages by running the `requirements.txt` file.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`

First, ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. To do this, you'll need to use the `requirements.txt` file. It can be installed using the following commands:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2. Open the Colab Notebook

To run the code in Google Colab, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the **notebook** in Jupyter Notebook by navigating to the URL of the notebook (if you have the link, paste it in your browser).
2. Once the notebook is open, ensure you have connected the runtime by clicking the **Connect** button on the top-right corner.

### 3. Running the Colab Code

The Colab notebook is divided into cells, and each cell contains a block of code that should be executed in order.

- **Running Cells**: To run each cell, click the **Play** button to the left of each cell or use **Shift + Enter** on your keyboard.

  **Note**: Ensure that you are running the cells sequentially to avoid errors.

### 4. Key Steps in the Colab Notebook

Here are the general steps you will follow within the notebook:

- **Install Dependencies**: The first cell in the notebook will contain commands to install the dependencies (e.g., `!pip install ...`). If not, refer to step 1 and install the packages.
  
- **Set up Environment**: The next set of cells will configure your environment by setting up variables, downloading resources, or preparing any data.

- **Run SentiTSMixer Code**: Follow the instructions and run the code cells that perform the sentiment analysis, data processing, and any other tasks involved in SentiTSMixer.

- **Output/Results**: Once all cells have been run, check the results in the final output sections of the notebook.

### 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors while running the cells, ensure that:

- You've installed all required dependencies.
- You've run the cells in the correct order.
- Your environment has access to the necessary resources (e.g., internet connection, storage).
